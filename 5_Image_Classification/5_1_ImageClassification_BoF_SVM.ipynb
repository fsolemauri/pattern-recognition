        "In this notebook, we will train an image classifier based on Bag of Features (BoF) and using SVMs. The BoF is a feature representation based on quantization. Using local features from a training dataset, these features are clustered and some representative features (the center data from each cluster) are used as reference. Once these representative features have been obtained, any image can be represented by a combination of these features. This process is done by extracting first the local features. Then, for each local feature, the nearest reference feature must be found. As a result, if we have M reference features (size of the codebook), the image will be represented as a vector f of dimension M, where each component $f_i$ will represent how many local features from the image have been assigned to the reference feature $i$. These vector representations of the images will be used to train an image classification system with Support Vector Machines."

For that, we will use Support Vector Machines (SVM) from the Scikit-learn library. We will also use the function train_test_split from this library to split the data into two subsets, one for training and another one for testing. Then, we train the model by using the method fit from the function SVC. Once the model has been trained, we obtain the classification accuracy by using the function score."
